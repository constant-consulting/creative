  description : Writing tests before production code sets up the correct expectations.
                As the system grows, these tests ensure that the software continues
                to behave as expected and without bugs. # stolen from 8th light, needs rewording

- title :       Agile
  image :       img/practices/agile-values.png
  description : We emphasize on the principles of the agile manifesto over the processes established.
                This has helped us questions various practices implemented in a team and select the
                ones that solve the contemporary problem and provide a continuous productive environment.

- title :       Small Iterations
  image :       img/practices/addie-process.png
  description : We believe that most software requirements are based on some form of assumptions. To make
                a product successful, we constantly revalidate the assumptions by working on short iterations
                that allows us to quickly revalidate those assumptions and adapt to the changing requirements.

- title :       Continuous Integration
  image :       img/practices/success-failure.jpg
  description : Multiple developers work on a single project, and to maintain the integrity of the project, we
                use control systems to merge and test the code so that we don't invalidate work already done.

- title :       Continuous Delivery
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : Any work done is not complete if it can not be delivered. We believe in delivering work to the
                market as soon as it is done so that the investment can reap the fruits early and the feedback
                is immediate. This allows the product to adapt to the market rapidly.

# - title :       User Research
#   image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
#   description : Systems are built mostly for users. To build the right system, we sample the users and understand
#                 what they really want, what they need and if the proposed or existing system is useful to them.

- title :       Pair programming
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : It has been established that writing code in pair produces higher quality result, encourages diversity
                of thought and surprisingly increases productivity significantly.
