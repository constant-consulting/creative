  description : Writing tests before production code sets up the correct expectations.
                This porvides a guarantee that the system behaves as expected, without
                bugs even as it grows.

- title :       Agile
  image :       img/practices/agile-values.png
  description : We emphasize on the principles of the agile manifesto over the processes established.
                This has helped us question various practices in our team and select the
                ones that solve the problem.

- title :       Small Iterations
  image :       img/practices/addie-process.png
  description : Most software requirements are based on some form of assumptions. To make
                a product successful, we work on short iterations, we constantly revalidating
                our assumptions.

- title :       Continuous Integration
  image :       img/practices/success-failure.jpg
  description : Multiple developers work on a single project, and to maintain the integrity of the project, we
                use control systems to merge and test the code so that we don't invalidate work already done.

- title :       Continuous Delivery
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : We believe in delivering work to the market as soon as it is completed
                This allows investment to reap the fruits early and the team can get feedback
                immediately helping us adapt to the market rapidly.

- title :       User Research
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : Systems are built mostly for users. To build the right system, we sample the users and understand
                what they really want, what they need and if the proposed or existing system is useful to them.

- title :       Pair programming
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : It has been established that writing code in pair produces higher quality result, encourages diversity
                of thought and surprisingly increases productivity significantly.

- title :       Devops
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : To be able to do continuous delivery, we need to be able to deliver
                fully baked infrastructure for our needs. Industry standard tools
                like chef, ansible, puppet,... do this for us.

- title :       Cloud
  image :       img/practices/redgreenrefactor.png
  description : Spinning off systems when needed saves a lot of development time and money.
                We utilize AWS, Rackspace, Digital Ocean and many more in the market to run projects
                for both tests and production.
