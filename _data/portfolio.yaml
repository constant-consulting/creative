- title :       Software Delivery
  description : Every project is unique, and needs its own right toolset, language
                and approach. We work with multiple languages and approaches.
                Also, buiding alone has no business value, it needs to be delivered.

  description:  A repeatetive guarantee of what works provides confidence to deliver.
                The impact area of a change grows with the project size. This is
                where test automation keeps the team sane and productive.

- title :       Continuous Delivery
  description:  Money spent on a feature lying on the shelf provides no return. This
                problem can be solved if we are able to release on demand with
                a single command and making sure it can be repeated when it is needed.

                more on <i>value based delivery</i> rather than <i>statistics</i>.
